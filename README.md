# FutureAlert
Nice looking alerts for your websites made with JavaScript

## Usage
First you'll need to add FutureAlert to your website. To do so, paste the code below into your `<head>` tag.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://caden-nz.github.io/FutureAlert/futureAlert.css"/>
<script src="https://caden-nz.github.io/FutureAlert/futureAlert.js"></script>
```

After you've done that, all you need to do to create an alert is type:
```js
futureAlert('Alert Type','Text')
```
**Alert Types:**
- Error
- Success
- Info
- Warning
- Default

The text can be anything as long as it is short.
